-- Brief Report

--[[
--Partitioning the Booking table by start_date allows the database to scan only the relevant partitions
--when executing queries that filter by date range. This reduces I/O and improves query performance,
--especially for large datasets. After partitioning, EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows that only the relevant
--partition(s) are scanned, resulting in faster query execution compared to the unpartitioned table.
